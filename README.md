# mlu_calculator
This is a Mean Length of Utterance Calculator built with Flask. It uses NLTK's Morfessor module and Vosk for speech-to-text recognition.

Vosk's model was not uploaded here but can easily be downloaded from: https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api
Front-end design is all thanks to: https://www.muicss.com/
This Flask app was deployed at: https://mlucalculator.herokuapp.com/
